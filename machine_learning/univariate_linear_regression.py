""" Often called "simple linear regression", univariate linear regression is a
    method for determining the best line 

    Since simple linear regression only uses a single predictor variable,
    it is of the form:

    y_pred = beta * x + alpha

    The values for alpha and beta are calculated as follows. 

    beta = correlation_x_y * (sample_standard_deviation_y / sample_standard_deviation_x)
    alpha = y - beta * x.
